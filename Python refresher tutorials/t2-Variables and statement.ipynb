    "## Data structures and variables\n",
    "In this tutorial, we are going to introduce the concept of data structures and variables. A data structure is a way you store data in computer memory, such as a number, a word, or a paragraph. A variable is a value that can change, depending on conditions or on information passed to the program. Using variables to hold data within our code, and show how they can be manipulated to perform whatever task we are intending to do. By the word variables, I mean using names to hold information rather than tapping in numbers as you'd do on a calculator."

    "#### Numbers\n",
    "Numbers are fairly straightforward. Python’s core object set includes the usual suspects: integers (numbers without a fractional part), floating-point numbers (roughly, numbers with a decimal point in them), and even more exotic types (unlimited-precision “long” integers, complex numbers with imaginary parts, fixed-precision decimals, and sets). Here, we focus on integers and floating-point numbers. Following are some example numbers supported by Python."

They are our first example of what we call a sequence in Python—that is, a positionally ordered collection of other objects. Sequences maintain a left-to-right order among the items they contain: their items are stored and fetched by their relative position. Strictly speaking, strings are sequences of one-character strings; other types of sequences include lists and tuples (covered later). Following are some examples of strings."

When python is executed, if there is a #, it will be ignored along with the rest of the line.\n",

    "I guarantee you will spend the vast majority of your time, particularly when learning coding, debugging errors in your code. YOU WILL I PROMISE YOU! Errors and removing them is part of your learning curve. Sometimes they are difficult to find and can drive you crazy! This part is only conquered with experience, so the more you code the better you will get. SO DO ALL THE EXERCISES I GIVE YOU - AND MORE :)\n",

Indentation is a way of telling a Python interpreter that the group of statements belongs to a particular block of code. It useful in if statements, loops and definations, we will introduce this later and don't indent casually for now. If you run the code python crashes and tells you it's an indent error on the second line!! Very helpful!!! :)\n"
